- **Maven** - [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **MySQL** - A MySQL database server (Aiven - I need to check if this fits).

```bash
com.stockapp
├── api          // Classes to interact with the Alpha Vantage API
├── model        // Data models for stock data
├── service      // Business logic for processing stock data
├── ui           // User interface (console or GUI)
└── util         // Utility classes (e.g., JSON parsing, error handling)
```

- **AlphaVantageClient (API interactions)**: Handles requests to Alpha Vantage and retrieves stock data.
